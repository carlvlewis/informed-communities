      <h3 class="p-line-height p-normal pad-bottom-mobile">Cities across the United States are making public data more open and accessible to their residents. Mayors and city staff are improving their policies and technical offerings to make more and more information about how local governments function available online.</h3>

      <h3 class="p-line-height p-normal pad-bottom-mobile">While open data policies and portals are invaluable components of improving local governments’ outcomes, the ultimate goal of all government work — including open data — is to improve the day-to-day lives of the people in a community.</h3>

      <h3 class="p-line-height p-normal pad-bottom-mobile">We have developed a framwork called Tactical Data Engagement, a process for cities to facilitate opportunities for the community use of open data to improve residents’ lives. It can be divided into a <strong>Discovery phase</strong> and an <strong>Action phase</strong>.</h3>

      <h3 class="p-line-height p-normal pad-bottom-mobile">The <strong>Discovery phase</strong> entails finding relevant issue areas to focus open data, and conducting user research to inform their open data efforts. The <strong>Action phase</strong> describes taking action with open data, through community partnerships with data intermediaries, data-sharing agreements, data user groups, or other collaborative community open data efforts.</h3>
