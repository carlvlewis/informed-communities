# Interested in getting certified through What Works Cities?

Sunlight Open Cities partners with Bloomberg Philanthropies’ [What Works Cities (WWC) Initiative](https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/) to provide direct technical assistance to U.S. cities to become more data-driven and data-democratized.

Whether cities are just starting out developing an open data policy, or beginning to dive deeper into engaging and mobilizing your community with open data, the Roadmap to Informed Communities has resources that can help cities work towards [WWC Certification](https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/certification/) the national standard of excellence for well-managed, data-driven local government..

Certification, which is open to any U.S. city with a population of 30,000 or more, helps local governments benchmark their progress and develop a roadmap for using data and evidence to deliver results for residents. Completing a [Certification assessment](https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4620807/NEW-2018-Certification-Application/) is the entry point to What Works Cities and accessing the range of support our partners offer.

Sunlight’s resources, including this site, primarily support What Works Cities in meeting **Open Data** and **Stakeholder Engagement** Certification criteria.
