  With this initiative in mind, the Office of Technology and Innovation asked civic design 
  firm Reboot to find out who the current and potential users of open data are. Reboot then 
  conducted research to design personas, which helped to identify a pipeline from current 
  to potential open data users so more people can be involved in community problem solving."
