Tactical Data Engagement is a four-step method for City Hall to help residents make an impact in their community using open data. The steps are:
1. **Find** a general focus area by observing community information needs
2. **Refine** information use cases by interviewing stakeholders
3. **Design** a plan by coordinating with target data users
4. **Implement** an intervention by collaborating with actual users.

## Background

Cities across the United States are making public data more open and accessible to their residents. Mayors and city staff are improving their policies and technical offerings to make more and more information about how local governments function available online. These developments represent a sea-change in our societal norms and expectations about the public right to government information. We believe Tactical Data Engagement is the next step in that cultural movement toward transparency and accountability. While open data policies and portals are invaluable components of improving local governments’ outcomes, the ultimate goal of all government work — including open data — is to improve the day-to-day lives of the people in a community.

This guide puts forth a vision for **Tactical Data Engagement \(TDE\)**. We created this method based on the core concepts of [human-centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design) and [tactical urbanism](https://issuu.com/streetplanscollaborative/docs/tactical_urbanism_vol_2_final), with steps that guide city officials in carrying out interventions that facilitate the community use of open data for local impact. This approach goes beyond basic resident engagement. It seeks to make open data programs more transparent, accountable, and participatory by challenging city halls to actively help residents use open data to better their communities.

The four steps outlined in this guide will help readers complete a resident-informed project, product, or tool that supports the community use of data.

Readers can carry out each of these steps “tactically” — using lightweight, adaptable, incremental, and inexpensive tactics that can be realistically catered to fit within a city hall’s or community’s unique constraints and capacities. The tactics are drawn from examples of good resident engagement around the country, and ensure that in every step, residents are collaborators in determining promising opportunities for impact through the community use of open data.

## Audience

**This guide is designed for city officials and other public servants who want to work with community actors to get more value out of open data and information.**

The TDE method is primarily for city officials who want to help residents generate impact and success stories using open data. However, this guide is also designed to be adaptable to meet the needs of a broad range of readers.

If you work for a city government with an open data program already in place, TDE can help you take that program to the next level by building on your policy and/or portal. TDE can also help city halls that are just starting out with open data begin sharing the right data with the right people, and begin demonstrating what open data success can look like.

If you are an advocate, researcher, librarian, or organizer who wants to incorporate the use of open data into your existing work with communities — or seek out opportunities to partner with governments in facilitating the community use of open data — TDE has a lot to offer you as well.

This broad applicability stems from TDE’s lightweight and adaptable tactics. Tactics can be applied to align with on-going activities and strategies, and they range in the level of effort and impact, thus providing options for governments with varying technical, data, or outreach capacity.

No matter where your community is in its open data work, we hope you enjoy reading about the TDE method, and are able to put these tactics to work!

## Step 1: Find

**Find a focus area by observing the community.**

* **THE ACTION:** Identify a general focus area with potential opportunities for the community use of open data.
* **THE ENGAGEMENT:** Observe, listen to, and analyze community needs.
* **THE COLLABORATORS:** A broad group of community members who can illuminate potentially impactful focus areas.
* **THE RESULT:** A focus area where community voices and needs suggest impactful opportunities for the community use of open data.

The first step in TDE is listening to your community’s priorities and concerns, and identifying the issue areas where open data might help. You may already be listening to residents’ concerns and needs by conducting surveys, maintaining relationships with trusted community groups, or regularly joining community meetings. Use each opportunity you have to collect and analyze broad community interest in open data. This is an opportunity to pay attention to any communities that are missing or excluded from conversations about public data and decision-making.

As you listen to and observe the community’s needs, identify opportunities where public data or information would empower residents to better understand, address, or collaborate to solve their concerns. Observe whether a majority of promising opportunities for the use of open data are clustered around a single issue or focus area. After listening to a variety of challenges that might require the community use of open data, choose a focus area by aligning those opportunities with the city’s on-going strategic priorities as well as with the cities information holdings.

## Step 2: Refine

**Refine use cases by interviewing stakeholders.**

* **THE ACTION:** Narrow and segment your focus area down to detailed use case scenarios, complete with user stories and personas that expose opportunities for the use of open data.
* **THE ENGAGEMENT:** Collect context and information from specific stakeholders via direct conversations or interviews.
* **THE COLLABORATORS:** Stakeholders who have academic or lived experience and insight into your chosen focus area, and who can refine the scenarios for potential open data use.
* **THE RESULT:** A few promising open data use cases that outline the potential impact of supporting specific open data use scenarios via user stories and user personas.

The second step in TDE is to refine your broad focus area into a more specific opportunity or “use case” with the help of people who have a deeper understanding of your chosen issue. “Use case” is a term meant to describe how data might be used by a certain user to solve a particular goal. The residents identified in these use cases will have “user personas” and you should take this time to develop your understanding of their stories. More than simply a problem statement, a use case scenario should dive deep into understanding a stakeholder who could use open data to address their concern within your focus area. In crafting various use case scenarios, remember that residents are experts in their own neighborhoods, communities, and issue areas, and listening to their knowledge will help refine the details around specific use cases in your focus area.

To complete this step, you should narrow down a few promising use case scenarios with particularly strong community partner support, strong resident interest, or obviously relevant gaps in information or data. Hearing about residents’ data use scenarios and incorporating their thoughts into what you determine are “promising” opportunities will help residents’ experiences matter in ultimately crafting a TDE intervention. Being as detailed as possible in this stage ensures that when you craft an intervention to address a single use case later on, the result will have dedicated end users, who you identified in this step, and will meet their real needs.

## Step 3: Design

**Design a plan by coordinating with target users.**

* **THE ACTION:** Select a single use case, and draft a plan for an intervention to support that use case.
* **THE ENGAGEMENT:** Share a draft plan and ask for feedback through multiple avenues.
* **THE COLLABORATORS:** Intended users of open data, based on the target audience for a specific intervention to support your chosen open data use case.
* **THE RESULT:** A user-informed plan that outlines an intervention to actively support and facilitate your chosen open data use case.

Examine your use cases from Step 2 and select a single one that has the most potential for an effective intervention. Take into account both your capacity and stakeholder interest. Limiting the opportunities in this step is crucial for taking a tactical, focused approach to facilitating the community use of open data, one use case scenario at a time.

Narrow down which specific stakeholders will be the intended users of relevant data and work more closely with them to begin mapping interventions like products, projects, or tools. Note that you are not carrying out an intervention in this step, but rather putting together a plan that you will carry out. Review the [implementation tactics in Step 4](https://sunlight-foundation.gitbooks.io/tactical-data-engagement/content/4-implement.html) so you can plan ahead accordingly. The plan generated in this step should outline the intervention that supports your chosen use case, and should feature feedback from intended users on how they would like to be incorporated.

Planning alongside the your intended users entails either collaboratively drafting a plan or soliciting feedback on a draft plan and incorporating responses. Collaborative planning with the intended data users in your community is essential for ensuring that planned interventions address exactly what data users need and account for details of implementation, for example, ensuring that the community agrees on who should house the project or sustain it once the government’s role is complete. A plan that hasn’t been reviewed by residents is less likely to be effective.

**“How formal does my plan need to be?”** It depends on your context. In a community that has already had lots of conversations about open data and shared goals, a short back and forth over email or an in-person conversation at a community meeting might be enough. In a community where there is less common understanding, you will probably need to do more work building consensus. The idea of Tactical Data Engagement is to focus on a specific end goal — use your judgment about how to best achieve that.

## Step 4: Implement

**Implement an intervention by collaborating with actual users.**

* **THE ACTION:** Execute your plan to carry out an intervention that supports the use case opportunity you outlined for better open data use in the community.
* **THE ENGAGEMENT:** Work with actual users to ensure the intervention meets their needs.
* **THE COLLABORATORS:** Members of the community who are the final, actual users of your open data.
* **THE RESULT:** A product, tool, or completed project where specific community members use open data in a new way thanks to your partnership and intervention.

This step is where you should help actual users, identified in the course of the method’s previous steps, to carry out the planned intervention that addresses your community-approved open data use case. Carrying out this intervention is the culmination of facilitating community use of open data. We developed the tactics in this section based on interventions that data providers and cities have used to facilitate community use of open data through projects, tools, or products. The opportunity to facilitate data use may mean sharing datasets that are not currently available in formats and with contents that best suit the needs of the requesters.

Commit to consistent or open feedback channels with residents to ensure you met needs and are driving toward impact. Note that the first solution may not always be the best one, and that those members of the community who contributed to the project — and who are the primary users or beneficiaries of community improvements through the use of open data — have crucial insight into any product’s usability.

The tactic you choose at this stage should build on your work from Steps 1, 2, and 3 and should meet the community’s needs as directly as possible.
