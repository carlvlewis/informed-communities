Tactical Data Engagement is a four-step method for City Hall to help residents make an impact in their community using open data. The steps are:
1. **Find** a general focus area by observing community information needs
2. **Refine** information use cases by interviewing stakeholders
3. **Design** a plan by coordinating with target data users
4. **Implement** an intervention by collaborating with actual users.

## Background

Cities across the United States are making public data more open and accessible to their residents. Mayors and city staff are improving their policies and technical offerings to make more and more information about how local governments function available online. These developments represent a sea-change in our societal norms and expectations about the public right to government information. We believe Tactical Data Engagement is the next step in that cultural movement toward transparency and accountability. While open data policies and portals are invaluable components of improving local governments’ outcomes, the ultimate goal of all government work — including open data — is to improve the day-to-day lives of the people in a community.

This guide puts forth a vision for **Tactical Data Engagement \(TDE\)**. We created this method based on the core concepts of [human-centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design) and [tactical urbanism](https://issuu.com/streetplanscollaborative/docs/tactical_urbanism_vol_2_final), with steps that guide city officials in carrying out interventions that facilitate the community use of open data for local impact. This approach goes beyond basic resident engagement. It seeks to make open data programs more transparent, accountable, and participatory by challenging city halls to actively help residents use open data to better their communities.

The four steps outlined in this guide will help readers complete a resident-informed project, product, or tool that supports the community use of data.

Readers can carry out each of these steps “tactically” — using lightweight, adaptable, incremental, and inexpensive tactics that can be realistically catered to fit within a city hall’s or community’s unique constraints and capacities. The tactics are drawn from examples of good resident engagement around the country, and ensure that in every step, residents are collaborators in determining promising opportunities for impact through the community use of open data.

## Audience

**This guide is designed for city officials and other public servants who want to work with community actors to get more value out of open data and information.**

The TDE method is primarily for city officials who want to help residents generate impact and success stories using open data. However, this guide is also designed to be adaptable to meet the needs of a broad range of readers.

If you work for a city government with an open data program already in place, TDE can help you take that program to the next level by building on your policy and/or portal. TDE can also help city halls that are just starting out with open data begin sharing the right data with the right people, and begin demonstrating what open data success can look like.

If you are an advocate, researcher, librarian, or organizer who wants to incorporate the use of open data into your existing work with communities — or seek out opportunities to partner with governments in facilitating the community use of open data — TDE has a lot to offer you as well.

This broad applicability stems from TDE’s lightweight and adaptable tactics. Tactics can be applied to align with on-going activities and strategies, and they range in the level of effort and impact, thus providing options for governments with varying technical, data, or outreach capacity.

No matter where your community is in its open data work, we hope you enjoy reading about the TDE method, and are able to put these tactics to work!

## Step 1: Find

We envision a country whose government consistently offers digital services that instill pride and trust, meet user needs, are secure, and are delivered quickly and at reasonable cost.

We develop partnerships with agencies to help them deliver exceptional digital experiences that address their strategic initiatives. Through our work together, we also aim to strengthen government technology practices in ways that last beyond our formal partnerships. We effect change by practicing user-centered development, testing to validate hypotheses, shipping often, and deploying products in the open.

## Step 2: Refine

We are a team of about 200 designers, software engineers, strategists, and product managers — all federal employees. We have offices in DC, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, as well as team members working remotely from all over the country.

Want to get to know our team a little better? These blog posts feature the voices of people from across 18F:

- [We asked over 100 of our coworkers: What was your path to 18F?]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/03/22/what-was-your-path-to-18f/)
- [We asked over 100 of our coworkers what they've loved working on?]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/03/23/what-have-you-loved-working-on/)
- [We asked everyone at 18F to reflect on the most meaningful project they worked on this year]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015/12/23/looking-back-2015-our-own-words/)

## Step 3: Design

In March 2014, a group of [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) started 18F to extend their efforts to improve and modernize government technology.

In 2016, 18F became part of the [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS), which also includes the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, the Office of Acquisitions, and the [Office of Products and Programs](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/124174). Like GSA's other services (the Federal Acquisition Service and the Public Building Service), TTS provides tools, services, and resources to help other agencies serve the public.

**What does 18F mean?**

Our name is short for the address of the GSA building where we're headquartered in Washington, DC: 1800 F Street.

## Step 4: Implement

We are cost-recoverable, which means we don't receive appropriated funds from Congress and must charge partner agencies for our work. There are two authorities we use to recover costs:

- Acquisition Services Fund (ASF) reimbursement authority: for work related to acquisitions
- [Economy Act (PDF)](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/mou-economyact.pdf) reimbursement authority: for projects that cannot use ASF reimbursement authority

We use [Interagency Agreements](https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/) (IAAs) to set up the terms of our projects, and bill partners through [Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/acctg/ipac/ipac_home.htm) (IPAC) on a monthly basis.
