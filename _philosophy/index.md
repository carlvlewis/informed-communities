## Preface

Since the beginning of the What Works Cities initiative, Sunlight's Open Cities team has helped over 60 U.S. cities enact open data policies and has tracked and analyzed open data policies in over 100 cities, counties, and states. We've come a long way in helping cities establish strong foundations for openness through open data policies, transparency initiatives, and open data portals. Writ large, Sunlight’s efforts have effectively bolstered the infrastructure for democratic access to government data in cities across the nation.

But, while a number of local governments have done a good job publishing [large amounts of data](https://index.okfn.org/), many have little to no idea who is actually using it. Businesses? Academic researchers? App developers? Policy advocates? Different users have different needs — and by figuring out who these users are, what they want, and why they want it, governments can reach out to specific users in the community and provide the _right_ data to help current and potential data users achieve impactful goals.

**Tactical Data Engagement is designed to help government staff and other community data providers to catalyze open data's _use_ for meaningful problem-solving by going beyond publishing open data policies and portals.**

We believe that local governments in particular must go beyond publishing open data because we fundamentally believe that [information is power](https://sunlightfoundation.com/about/) and that _all residents_ have a democratic right not only to access information but to use it. Our vision is that city halls and other governments will use Tactical Data Engagement to catalyze action in communities with the highest need for access to government and public information. In particular, we hope city leaders will use this framework to identify and reach out to disenfranchised community members with real information needs, and make a concerted effort to support those communities in using public information for local action. We believe that if all local governments took an intentional, equity-based approach to open data, they could bring real access to power and decision-making to marginalized communities that often go overlooked as audiences for civic technology, open data, and transparency.

Community use of open data is, at its core, about radically valuing residents’  needs as well as the outcomes governments and residents can achieve together when residents are placed at the center of tech and data innovation. We believe in the idea that people are experts in their own lives, and have woven explicit commitments to human-centered design into this guide. This guide encourages readers to ask: What can governments do to actively facilitate opportunities for open data use in communities? Where are information gaps that governments might help to close? And how can government become an equal partner with residents in leveraging open data for community impact?

We hope this guide helps communities everywhere answer those questions.

## Introduction

Learn about how we built Tactical Data Engagement, and how to use this guide as a hands-on resource.

#### What is Tactical Data Engagement?

Tactical Data Engagement (TDE) is a four-step framework designed for local government staff develop a resident-centered culture of open data _(in the long-term)_ and generate buy-in for resident-centered open data through tactical, meaningful wins for the community _(in the short-term)_.

<div class="funfact-blockquote">
If you don't work for a local government, you can still use this framework to help identify opportunities and catalyze resident-centered open data use. Skip to the next section for more info.
</div>

We created this framework based on the core concepts of [human-centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design) and [tactical urbanism](https://issuu.com/streetplanscollaborative/docs/tactical_urbanism_vol_2_final), with steps that guide city officials toward _carrying out an intervention_ that facilitates the community use of open data for local impact. This approach goes beyond basic resident engagement. It seeks to make open data programs more holistically resident-centered by challenging city halls to first understand and then act to help residents use open data.

We hope readers will use this framework as a hands-on guide by following the steps of TDE, or as a tool for communicating what's possible with resident-centered open data.

_We built this guide to be adaptable._

We acknowledge that every city, town, place, or neighborhood is different. So rather than creating restrictive rules for how to carry out each step of the process, we point to expertise in the fields of user-centered design, design research, civic tech, and others to point out which adaptable, incremental, and inexpensive tactics are already out there. The most important thing is that at every step, readers challenge themselves to consider how residents can be more directly incorporated to decision-making and experimentation with open data for community problem-solving.

#### Who should use Tactical Data Engagement?

This guide was originally designed for city officials and other public servants who want to work with community actors to get more value out of open data and information. But anyone who is a _data provider,_ or who needs to begin segmenting and investigating opportunities for community use of open data can use the strategies we outline here.

This guide can help you scope out which problems are appropriate for open data solutions. It can help you research and segment the current and potential users of your open data. It can help you co-design and work alongside key stakeholders to plan a real community-informed solution. And it can help you enter into collaborative community partnerships with concrete intentions around _who_ you're aiming to support, _what_ you can provide, and _why_ your collaboration is important.

If you work for a city government with an open data program already in place, TDE can help you take that program to the next level by building on your policy or portal. TDE can also help city halls that are just starting out with open data begin sharing the right data with the right people, and begin demonstrating what open data success can look like.

If you are an advocate, researcher, librarian, or organizer who wants to incorporate the use of open data into your existing work with communities — or seek out opportunities to partner with governments in facilitating the community use of open data — TDE has a lot to offer you as well.

No matter where your community is in its open data work, we hope you enjoy reading about the TDE method, and are able to put these tactics to work!

## The Framework

Tactical Data Engagement can help data providers complete tactical, lightweight projects while building toward long-term human-centered open data practice.

In this guide, we lay out a sequence for Tactical Data Engagement that starts with broad problem scoping and ends with supporting a tactical, lightweight, specific opportunity for community use of open data. This framework is perfect for testing out principles of human-centered open data and demonstrating value through resident-centered stories of impact.

While Tactical Data Engagement is laid out as a step-by-step process, it is also a modular, adaptable collection of resources that any data providers can use to build human-centered practice into their open data efforts. Government staff can benefit from training data owners in this framework's modular strategies, with or without completing a beginning-to-end Tactical Data Engagement pilot project.

This process is meant to be repeated, or _iterated_, so that it can be applied to new opportunities for communities to use open data. Over time and various iterations, TDE can help local leaders develop a more open culture and consistently facilitate a community’s use of open data with varying members of the community and across various opportunities.

### Step 1: Find

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunlightpolicy/gitbook-tde/master/assets/tde-1.png)

The first step in TDE is listening to analyzing community demand signals for transparency, open data, or even policy change, and identifying the issue areas where open data might help.

<div class="funfact-blockquote">
In this step, you should aim to:
<br>☑ Evaluate your internal priorities for open data
<br>☑ Listen to community demands for transparency, information, and data
<br>☑ Identify which priorities overlap
<br>☑ Choose to proceed with a clear focus area
</div>

You may already be listening to residents’ concerns and needs by conducting surveys, maintaining relationships with trusted community groups, or regularly joining community meetings. Use each opportunity you have to collect and analyze broad community interest in open data.

As you listen to and observe the community’s needs, identify opportunities where public data or information would empower residents to better understand, address, or collaborate to solve their concerns. Observe whether a majority of promising opportunities for the use of open data are clustered around a single issue or focus area.

**The result: A clear focus area**

After listening to a variety of challenges that might require the community use of open data, choose a focus area by aligning those opportunities with the city’s on-going strategic priorities as well as with the cities information holdings.

## A Modular Approach

Even without using the step-by-step guide to Tactical Data Engagement, the strategies at the center of this approach matter.

#### Open data needs a focus to be effective

Data with an unclear focus will have unclear impact. Data providers inside and outside of city governments should consider which issues their data will help to address before they decide to share and promote engagement with that data. Part of sharing human-centered open data at a city level means ensuring that open data is not only tied to a specific issue, but that that issue is relevant in supporting the local community.

For example, cities should not publish data on transit just because the data exists, but also because community members have indicated that they want the city to improve transit and provide more transparency around transit-related issues. Data providers can leverage _problem scoping_ strategies like the ones that we've built into [Step 1: Find](https://sunlight-open-cities.gitbook.io/tde-guide/the-framework/step-1-find) to ensure that open data sets or projects are grounded in issues that communities care about.

#### Cities should invest in understanding data users

In private industries, customer segmentation and market research are essential for businesses to understand and meet their clients' needs. If local governments want to be more effective in fighting pressing local challenges, they need to invest in design research to understand and document their stakeholders' needs. We think that focusing in on residents' data and information needs provides a helpful framing that can ground this research in actionable opportunities for impact.

Unlike in private industries, local governments have a democratic responsibility to provide equal opportunity and access to public data and services for all residents. Segmenting current and potential data users can not only help local governments build stronger understanding of their constituencies but can also help them focus in on supporting potential data users with the highest need. Data providers can leverage _user-centered design strategies_ like the ones we outlined in [Step 2: Refine](https://sunlight-open-cities.gitbook.io/tde-guide/the-framework/step-2-refine) to start building a thorough understanding of their residents' data and information needs.

#### Residents want a say in how public data and tech are applied

The public should always have an opportunity to contribute to the decision-making behind technology and data projects that will ultimately affect them. In general, inviting stakeholder participation in project design can help improve the effectiveness of the end product in meeting stakeholders' needs. Specifically, local governments have a responsibility to open their decision-making to local residents when it comes to experimentation and innovation using public data and technology.

Data providers must incorporate resident input, either through user testing, survey efforts, or hands-on co-creation, into the open data pilot projects to ensure that end products of open data projects will actually meet stakeholders' needs. By designing _with_ members of their communities, local government staff can also work to ensure that their data and tech projects are designed by inclusive, diverse teams. Data providers and local government staff alike can use co-creation strategies like the ones we outline in [Step 3: Design](https://sunlight-open-cities.gitbook.io/tde-guide/the-framework/step-3-design)to begin engaging their residents to design effective products.

#### Institutions need to pony up for community partnerships

Without concrete commitments to community partnerships and collaboration, open data projects between data providers and users may lack sustainability and real impact. Different types of projects to open up or apply public data require different levels of commitment on the part of data providers or local governments. Tactical Data Engagement provides an opportunity for local governments to reconsider exactly how they partner with their constituencies across the board, and may encourage them to think outside the box when it comes to taking a hands-on, human-centered approach to fostering community problem-solving and innovation with tech and data.

Data providers can use the strategies and tools we provide in [Step 4: Implement](https://sunlight-open-cities.gitbook.io/tde-guide/the-framework/step-4-implement) to better evaluate their own capacity to be true partners with their local data users. Governments in particular should be aware that data and tech-driven community collaborations will deteriorate without formalized commitments to institutional support.
